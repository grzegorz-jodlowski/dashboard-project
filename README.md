## <a name="about"></a>What's this project about?

This is a SPA (Single Page Application) as a admin panel.
It can be implemented as a dashboard for many business fields, has a sidebar with navigation and a top bar with user data.
The whole page is coded with RWD (Responsive Web Desidn) rules.
Interesting thing is the interactive graph with adjustment to the window size.

- analyze the design to divide into components and sections,
- use <a href='http://getbem.com/introduction/'>BEM</a> in a more advanced way,
- create styleguide as an improvement in component design and know how <i>naked elements</i> will look like,
- test responsiveness using responsive mode in the browser inspector,
- create a mobile menu in the form of a sidebar (eg. <a href='https://tympanus.net/Development/SidebarTransitions/'>sidebar transitions</a>),
- handle the difficulty of displaying long content on a page that cannot be reduced (eg. <a href='https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/azeYqx'>Responsive Table with Tablesaw</a>),
- add a scrolling wrapper to part of the page (eg. <a href='https://css-tricks.com/pure-css-horizontal-scrolling/'>CSS tricks</a>),
